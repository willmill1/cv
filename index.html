                <p><em>System Administrator and Aspiring Web Developer</em></p>
                <p>I have been working as a System Administrator for about 4 years now. 
                As part of the IaaS team in my organization, my primary roles center around managing Cisco UCS hardware and VMware technologies that
                facilitate our private cloud. More specifically, I manage Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects, Chassis, and Servers; and I utilize VMware
                technologies such as vCenter, ESXi, vRealize, and VROPs.</p>
                <p>Having used these past few years to learn as much as possible, while also striving to achieve various technical certifications
                and a masters degree, I am now ready to move on to something more challenging. My primary goals right now are: (1) to
                complete an online Web Developer Bootcamp while also developing an impressive portfolio of projects, (2) to work 
                through the various levels of the AWS Cloud Certificates (I just passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam and I am currently
                working toward the AWS Developer Associate Certificate), and (3) to achieve a position as a professional web developer.
