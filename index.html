                <p><em>System Administrator and Aspiring Web Developer</em></p>
                <p>I have been working as a System Administrator for about 4 years now. 
                As part of the IaaS Private Cloud Team, my primary roles center around managing Cisco UCS hardware such as Fabric Interconnects,
                Chassis, and Servers. I also utilize VMware technologies such as vCenter, ESXi, vRealize, and VROPs.</p>
                <p>Having used these past few years to learn as much as possible, while also striving to achieve various technical certifications
                and a masters degree, I am now ready to move on to something more challenging. My primary goals right now are to (1) to
                complete an online Web Developer Bootcamp through Udemy while also developing an impressive portfolio of projects, (2) to work 
                through the various levels of the AWS Cloud Certificates (I just passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam and I am currently
                working toward the AWS Developer Associate Certificate), and (3) to achieve a position as a professional web developer.
